This is a repository of scripts developed for the whole genome analyses of RADSeq data associated with the manuscript entiteled "Photosynthetic diversity in sympatry is maintained in a grass species despite gene flow and habitat overlap", Olofsson et al 2020

Please follow the scripts in numerical order. Links to the download pages of all necessary programs are provided in the 0_program file. 

All necessary files for the analyses are provided in the files folder. Data generated during the analyses of the data for the above manuscript are provided in the files folder as indicated in the individual scripts. These files can be used to execute the commands in the two analyses scripts (5a and 5b) without going through all the steps from raw read to cleaned variants (script 1 through 4).
